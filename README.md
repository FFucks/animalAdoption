# animalAdoption

API Project for animal adoption.

To deploy this application first need to clone this repository, build maven project using command (mvn clean install) and start/deploy the file AnimalAdoptionApplication.java on your IDE.

The projct are set on http://localhost:8080 addres but you can switch in the file application.yml, it is not necessary configuration any database becouse the project uses H2 databases which simulates a database when the project start (also shutdown the database when the app is down).

The file for test the API endpoints on postman are in file animal-adoption.postman_collection.json, you can inport this file in your postman app and test the application.

The project also have Unit tests using mockito, that are set on "test" package.

Any doubt you can send me a message on:
